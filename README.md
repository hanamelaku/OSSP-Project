system call listen()
listen() is a function used in socket programming to mark a socket as passive, allowing it to accept incoming connection requests. When a server socket is created, it must be set to listen for connections before it can accept them from clients. The listen() function specifies the maximum number of pending connections that can be queued while waiting for acceptance.
